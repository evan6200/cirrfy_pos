Subject: [PATCH 2471/2666] ENGR00256933 ASoC: WM8962: Add delay after
 FLL-enable

  There's a start-up time after FLL_ENA bit is set. While the driver didn't
run the delay code which already exists in the set_fll() function.
  This patch let the driver run into the delay section, and made it work more
perfectly.
